This is pre-released software given to you in the hopes
that we as a community can build and develop a system that
can provide for the likes of the community.

To start this toolkit is designed for use by anyone to
develop for and design an interfaces for the Wombat ISE
system.  In the development and continual use of this toolkit
we hope that Wombat ISE will become a system that will be
widely used.
